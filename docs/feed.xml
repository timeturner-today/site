As President John F. Kennedy said, “[just] to try to hold fast is to be swept aside”. Through objective  discourse, engaging conversations with today’s leaders, we strive not to not just hold fast but to empower,  connect people.

Brightly colored paper, the scent of freshly sharpened colored pencils, and the boisterous laughter of my classmates fill my classroom. We are making Mother’s Day cards and are supposed to fill the page with a sweet letter to our moms. But I sit at my desk, frozen, unsure who to address the letter to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dear Amma,” I scrawl, then look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dear Mom,” is the most common, sitting proudly at the top of almost every page. Classmates all around me write to the moms or mamas, but I am slowly becoming aware that the first word out of my mouth, the word I have used to call for help and comfort, is different. There is no “Amma” to be found, no homage to strong and stern hand that packs my backpack and lunchbox and tells me to study hard, and for the first time, I feel alone in my difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look back to my scrawny words, scribbled at the top of my letter, and erase them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dear Mama,” I write, painfully aware of the wrongness, and almost ashamed of a word that has protected me for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/kamala-harris-childhood.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Credit: Kamala Harris&quot; style=&quot;float: left;margin-right:4px;margin-left:6px;&quot; /&gt;
There are thousands of stories like mine. Stories of little brown South Asian girls who feel afraid to eat their rice and curries and get mocked for the pungent smell that sticks to their clothes. Stories of little brown South Asian girls who reckon with the feeling of difference and feel like there is only one path. Stories of little brown South Asian girls who are trapped by their gender and brown skin. We are the thousands of women whose experiences are reflected in the Democratic nominee for Vice President, Kamala Harris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris was raised by her single Tamil mother, who had come to the United States by herself at age 19. Her mother met her Jamaican father when they were graduate students at UC Berkeley and through her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement in Oakland. She would raise Harris as a single mother after they divorced and would juggle her career as a breast cancer researcher with motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/icons/icon-bell-120x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“I devoted my life to making real the words carved in the United State’s Supreme Court: equal justice under the law.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris remembers that her mother would often tell her and her sister Maya not to “just sit around and complain about things, [but to] [d]o something.” She speaks of this fondly, in her first speech as the vice-presidential nominee. “So, I did something,” she says. “I devoted my life to making real the words carved in the United States’ Supreme Court: equal justice under law. And 30 years ago, I stood before a judge for the first time, breathed deep, and uttered the phrase that would truly guide my career […], Kamala Harris for the people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that Harris is the vice-presidential nominee. Her biracial identity brings a diverse perspective, and her story plays into the great legend of America. The union of two immigrants, her mother and father, from vastly different backgrounds on opposite sides of the world, who came to pursue a better education, tell us of what America aspires to be. As Harris breaks barriers for women of color, fellow Americans look to them to rejoice that someone who shares our experiences has become a part of the national conversation. And we celebrate that a strong woman of color has a place at the table, but not without a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/icons/icon-bell-120x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“We cannot celebrate Senator Harris for breaking glass ceilings […] without acknowledging her record as a prosecutor or the harassment she has faced on her identity as a biracial women.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/kamala-harris-podium.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Credit: Vice Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris&quot; style=&quot;float: left;margin-right:4px;margin-left:6px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot celebrate Senator Harris for breaking glass ceilings for women of color without acknowledging her contradictory record as a prosecutor. Additionally, her ascent to becoming the vice-presidential nominee does not allow Americans to congratulate themselves without recognizing the racist, sexist, and demeaning harassment that has followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Senator Harris became the Junior Senator for California, she served as the Attorney General for the state and the district attorney of San Francisco. As a prosecutor, Harris’s record is hard to pin down as either tough on crime or a reformer of the criminal justice system. She defended California’s death penalty in court but refused to seek it against a man that killed a police officer. She both kept the wrongfully imprisoned in jail and pushed programs to help people get jobs and stay out of prison. Additionally, she implemented training for police officers on racial biases but did not investigate certain police shootings. Contradictions mire Harris’s record and make it confusing for progressives and people of color to support her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a senator, Harris is shown to be supportive of multiple criminal justice reform goals. In Harris’s criminal justice reform plan, she offered a rebuke to critics when she supported abolishing discriminatory mandatory minimum sentencing and stopping private prisons. She endorsed the First Step Act, and proposed nationwide bail reform as a US Senator. It seems that Harris is taking steps forward to make amends and reform a system that has repeatedly put down people of color and lower-income families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/icons/icon-bell-120x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“Senator Harris […] has faced critics attempting to disassemble her Americanness, her blackness, and every other facet of her identity.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Harris’s record is not the only thing we must acknowledge before we congratulate ourselves. Within the week it was announced that Senator Harris would be the vice-presidential nominee, President Trump had already thrown birther accusations at her. These accusations remain acutely similar to those former President Barack Obama weathered for most of his presidency. These accusations are blatant forms of racism levied against any person of color standing for a national office. While John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone, he faced little scrutiny when he ran for president in 2008, his opponent, Barack Obama, was often accused of birtherism despite being born in Hawaii. Senator Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, has faced critics attempting to disassemble her Americanness, her blackness, and every other facet of her identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, even before announced as Biden’s VP pick, Harris dealt with double standards influenced by her gender. Former Senator Chris Dodd, complained to a donor that Harris had shown “no remorse” for her significant blow against Biden in the first Democratic debate. Dodd’s logic, that disagreement with a political opponent was a fatal quality in a potential vice-president would have eliminated George H.W Bush as Reagan’s vice president, who often staunchly and directly disagreed with him when running for the Republican nomination. The implication that women, specifically women of color, cannot challenge an opponent without it being held against them, plays into the belief that ambitious women are detrimental to men. This belief was also widely used to propagate harmful misinformation about Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/icons/icon-bell-120x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“As Harris’s mother said, we cannot “just sit around and complain.” We must continue the fight. We must “do something.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harris is a significant step forward, from the perspective of breaking the glass ceiling. She manages to unite moderate Democrats to the more progressive views of her younger colleagues. She has adapted to change and learned from her mistakes. Her prosecutor record may be contradictory, but as a senator, she has consistently shown support for issues that matter to people of color. But Americans cannot pat themselves on the shoulder just yet. She remains a reminder for the little brown South Asian girls, like me, that people who look like us are treated as if they are not American. She remains a reminder that women like us are accused of being “too ambitious.” And she remains a reminder that women who look like us must fight harder for any claim to leadership. But, as Kamala Harris’s mother said, we cannot “just sit around and complain.” We must continue the fight. We must “do something.”&lt;/p&gt;

Half of the national population was spending significantly more on day-to-day purchases, such as hygiene products, apparel, and even children’s toys. They made up our country’s teachers, laborers, politicians, daughters, wives, and mothers. And on average, they spend almost $1,351 more a year on extra costs compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies had divided the market into two different segments: men and women. They marketed products to each gender and customized them to suit each genders’ “needs.” Companies notched up prices on the women’s side of the market to allow lower prices on the men’s products. This price difference in products targeting women versus men is known as the pink tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a New York City Department of Consumer Affairs study on the cost of being a female consumer, they found that in 42% of all their recorded instances, women paid more for a similar product. In comparison, in only 18% of their cases, men paid a higher price. Additionally, the study found that women’s products cost, on average, 7% more than men’s products. In toys and accessories for children, girl’s toys cost 7% more. Unsurprisingly, women’s clothing costs 8% more than men’s clothing, and most astonishingly, personal care items, like razors, lotions, and hair products, were a striking 13% higher for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/icons/icon-bell-120x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“The Pink Tax holds women to a financial and economic disadvantage.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/pink-tax-price-female.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit: Graphic by Erik Krouskop/ The Et Cetera and Eastfield News&quot; style=&quot;float: left;margin-right:4px;margin-left:6px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An average of 7% more on each product may not seem drastic at first, but as each charge builds up, a woman spends almost $1,351 more annually on unfairly priced products. When women make much less money – 81 cents to a man’s dollar – and spend more on products, the pink tax hinders a women’s ability to save her money. The pink tax holds women to a financial and economic disadvantage. It inhibits women from social and economic mobility, which creates a wealth disparity between men and women across America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the pink tax takes advantage of societal pressures for women to be overly conscious of their body image. When studying the price differences of Old Navy’s plus-size jeans, there was a notable $12 to $15 difference between women’s plus-sized jeans and their counterparts. On the contrary, there was no substantial difference in pricing for men’s Old Navy jeans and their plus-sized equivalents. Old Navy’s pricing system highlights the ostracization of plus-sized women, whom the pink tax punishes for both their gender and body. Companies continue to take advantage of the higher standard of body image set for women to sell higher-priced counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/icons/icon-bell-120x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;” Minimizing pink tax […] ignores examples of unpair pricing and reinforces a system that makes it harder for women to be financially independent”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some economists, like Jennifer Doleac, believe that price discrimination is better for the market because it allows more people to access the product for a lower price. However, the lower price only reaches half of the consumers – the male segment of the market. Doleac suggests that women diligently avoid pink-taxed products and buy from companies that do not resort to price discrimination. However, Linda Yueh, an author and economist, believes that federal regulation would create the best impact. Yueh suggests that price discrimination isn’t better for the market because consumers are paying higher prices to get products that aren’t inherently better than their cheaper counterparts. Since consumers buy certain products simply because of marketing practices, it doesn’t result in increased innovation and improvement in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/pink-tax-13-razor.png&quot; alt=&quot;400x200&quot; style=&quot;float: right;margin-right:4px;margin-left:6px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue against passing legislation to regulate the pink tax, citing that women are paying for a higher selection of products. In many cases, this is not true; in terms of baby clothing and strollers’ or toys and accessories, there are equal numbers of products for both genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the razors market, which is heavily pink taxed, is geared towards men and contains many more male products. Yet, there is a vast price difference between the two: in the case of Bic’s male and female razors, the male razors were 78 cents each, while the female razors were $1.08, making it a 32% difference. Minimizing the pink tax as the price women must pay for having more options ignores examples of unfair pricing and reinforces a system that makes it harder for women to be financially independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way to resolve the pink tax. In some markets, companies may lose profits because their market for women holds more choice and expense. But in others, women are unfairly charged for products. From a consumer’s standpoint, distinguishing whether the price difference is either discriminatory or fair is difficult and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way to resolve the pink tax, but campaigns like Axe the Pink Tax are trying. Campaigns have both partnered with legislators and brought newfound publicity to the issue. Companies like Billie have worked to create innovative products for women, while also eliminating the pink tax from their products. Supporting campaigns and companies that continue to spread awareness and price products fairly can result in more companies eliminating the pink tax in their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, people can take part in Jennifer Doleac’s solution by being diligent consumers that spend their money at places that do not enforce the pink tax. They can support the Pink Tax Repeal Act, which would allow the Federal Trade Commission to implement rules on disproportionate pricing for each gender, as Linda Yueh suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an issue that affects the entirety of the national population – not just half, because the pink tax can both benefit and disadvantage consumers – it deserves to be thought about, discussed, and acted upon. Today, consumers hold companies accountable for the social consequences of their actions or inactions. As consumers, we have enormous power. As consumers, we can vote with our wallets. And as consumers, we can eliminate the pink tax.&lt;/p&gt;
