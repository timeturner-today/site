# Mission
TimeTurner was started as an idea that we could look back at history through the lens of current events, and work towards the future with solutions to issues we face today. As we continue to break barriers, drive towards change, and make monumental decisions, the shadow of history continues to fall over our lives today. While we cannot change the past, TimeTurner hopes to encourage discourse on how humanity has both leaped and stumbled throughout history, and how each action affects us inherently today.
